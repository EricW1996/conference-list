## Rumor Propagation with the Effect of Debunking Information
--------

*Abstract*: Billions of data are generated from social media, such as Twitter and Facebook, which also provide a platform for fast rumor propagation. Validating the massive yet fast-spreading social media data is becoming extremely important but also challenging. By referencing the top 216 most widely spread rumors between May and July 2017 from Snopes.com, the first and largest fact-checking site online, we tracked the propagation of these rumors through millions of tweets on Twitter. In this paper, we examined the rumor cascade characteristics of both rumor and the associated debunking information. The time-series evolution of the rumors at different phases are monitored and analyzed, especially before and after rumor-busting media fact-checked the rumor. We also applied several machine learning algorithms to classify tweets of a rumor at different time intervals, in order to analyze the influence of Snopes.com in the propagation of rumors. The results of the experiment show that the proposed algorithm can effectively classify rumors with acceptable accuracy, with statistics showing that the propagation of online rumors can be mitigated after being verified by the fact-checking website generally.
